# soc-notes

Daily notes from School of Code lectures, guest speakers and mindset sessions.

9/6/22

The start of the project! 
My note taking with SOC started with OneNote, but as the code got more complex with more lines, my screenshot imports weren't scaling very well and were very pixelated, so I started keeping daily notes in Word. This then made it easy to share with fellow bootcampers who had missed any sessions and I got more requests before it was suggested I host them on GitHub - many thanks to Skandy for this great idea.
I hope they can be of use!
